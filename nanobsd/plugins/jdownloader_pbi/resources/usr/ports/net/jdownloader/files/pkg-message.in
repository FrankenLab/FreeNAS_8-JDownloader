You need to set/EXPORT your X11 DISPLAY variable before running JDownloader.
In the jdownloader script located in /usr/local/sbin, there is an example line
commented out.

If you prefer to run JDownloader "Headless", Xvfb has been included as
a dependency so you can then use VNC to attach and control a virtual
X Display, Xvfb and view JDownloader. The disadvantage to this method
is that JDownloader will not be able to detect selected links from
the client and also may possibly crash if a catcha prompt pops up. The 
advantage is you can disconnect and let it run in the background.

You need to install x11vnc: "pkg_add -r x11vnc" and also add the following
lines to /usr/local/sbin/jdownloader:

Xvfb :1 -screen 0 1024x768x16
x11vnc -usepw -nevershared -forever -display :1
exec java -Xmx512m -jar %%JAVASHAREDIR%%/JDownloader/JDownloader.jar -rfu

Now start your vnc client and connect to the IP address of the system
running JDownloader.

The first time you run x11vnc, it will ask you to choose a password
you will use when connecting with VNC.

If you run into difficulties building with this option, make sure you update
libdrm (portupgrade -f libdrm), and possibly need to do (portmaster -r pcre-8.31)
as well as cd /usr/local/ports/textproc/p5-XML-Parser and make reinstall

JDownloader also has several different web interface plugins you can enable
from the GUI which allow you to control and add downloads.

If you choose to uninstall JDownloader, there may be some config and temporary
files in %%JAVASHAREDIR%%/JDownloader that need to be removed manually.
