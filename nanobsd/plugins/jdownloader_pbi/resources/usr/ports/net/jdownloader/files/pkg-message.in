You need to set/EXPORT your X11 DISPLAY variable before running JDownloader.
In the jdownloader script located in /usr/local/sbin, there is an example line
commented out.

If you prefer to run JDownloader "Headless", you can set the option in the
Makefile USE_DISPLAY= yes, then you can use VNC to attach and control
a virtual X Display, Xvfb and view JDownloader. The disadvantage to this
method is that JDownloader will not be able to detect selected links from
the client and also may possibly crash if a catcha prompt pops up. The 
advantage is you can disconnect and let it run in the background.

You need to install x11vnc: "pkg_add -r x11vnc" and then you also
need to edit/add the following lines to /usr/local/sbin/jdownloader:

Xvfb :1 -screen 0 1024x768x16 & x11vnc -usepw -nevershared -forever -display :1
exec java -Xmx512m -jar %%JAVASHAREDIR%%/JDownloader/JDownloader.jar -rfu

The first time you run the command it will ask you to choose a password
that you will use when connecting with VNC.

If you run into difficulties building with this option, make sure you update
libdrm (portupgrade -f libdrm), and you may possibly need to do (portmaster -r pcre-8.31)

JDownloader also has several different web interface plugins you can enable
from the GUI which allow you to control and add downloads.

If you choose to uninstall JDownloader, there may be some config and temporary
files in %%JAVASHAREDIR%%/JDownloader that need to be removed manually.
