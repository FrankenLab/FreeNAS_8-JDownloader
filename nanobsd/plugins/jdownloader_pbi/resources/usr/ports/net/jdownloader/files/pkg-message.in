You need to set/EXPORT your X11 DISPLAY variable before running JDownloader.
In the jdownloaderd script located /usr/local/sbin, there is an example line
commented out.

The configuration files are installed in %%PREFIX%%/etc/serviio --
but only the logging configuration and the player device-profiles
may be changed there -- the library is set via the GUI program
serviio-console (see below).

The database will be located under /var/db/serviio/.

Remember to set serviio_enable=YES in /etc/rc.conf for the service to
start at boot. It will run as user ``%%USER%%''.

When the server is running, run the %%PREFIX%%/bin/serviio-console (a
GUI program) on the same host -- as yourself -- to configure it.
