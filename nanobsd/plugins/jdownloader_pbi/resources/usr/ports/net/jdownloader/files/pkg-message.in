You need to set/EXPORT your X11 DISPLAY variable before running JDownloader.
In the jdownloader script located in /usr/local/sbin, there is an example line
commented out.

If you prefer to run JDownloader "Headless", Xvfb has been included as
an option so you can then use VNC to attach and control a virtual
X Display, Xvfb and view JDownloader. The disadvantage to this method
is that JDownloader will not be able to detect selected links from
the client and also may possibly crash if a captcha prompt pops up. The 
advantage is you can disconnect and let it run in the background. Run
"make config" and check Xvfb to enable this option. Enabing this option
also will install x11vnc which will be required for this.

You need add/change the following lines to /usr/local/sbin/jdownloader:

Xvfb :1 -screen 0 1024x768x16

export DISPLAY=:1

exec x11vnc -usepw -nevershared -forever -display :1

exec java -Xmx512m -jar %%JAVASHAREDIR%%/JDownloader/JDownloader.jar


Now start your vnc client and connect to the IP address of the system
running JDownloader.

The first time you run x11vnc, it will ask you to choose a password
you will use when connecting with VNC.

If you run into difficulties building with this option, try the following:

1) make sure you update libdrm (portupgrade -f libdrm)

2) Update pcre (portmaster -r pcre-8.31)

3) cd /usr/local/ports/textproc/p5-XML-Parser and make reinstall

portupgrade and portmaster can be found in /usr/ports/ports-mgmt

You can also run JDownloader as a service %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/jdownloaderd

JDownloader also has several different web interface plugins you can enable
from the GUI which allow you to control and add downloads.

If you choose to uninstall JDownloader, there may be some uniquely named
config and temporary files in %%JAVASHAREDIR%%/JDownloader that need to
be removed manually.
